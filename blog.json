  "content": "In recent years, educators and parents around the world have noticed a worrying trend: many students seem to be losing interest in studying. Laziness toward learning is becoming more common, leading to poor academic performance, lack of critical thinking, and even low self-motivation in life. While technology, lifestyle changes, and social influences are major contributors, there are deeper issues at play. Below are ten reasons why students are becoming more lazy to study, followed by possible solutions that government, parents, and educators can take to reverse this trend.</p> <p><strong>1. Distractions from Technology</strong></p> <p>Smartphones, video games, and social media have become irresistible distractions. Instead of focusing on schoolwork, many students spend hours scrolling, chatting, or gaming.</p> <p><strong>2. Lack of Clear Goals</strong></p> <p>When students cannot see the long-term benefit of education, they lose motivation. Many no longer connect studying with their future success.</p> <p><strong>3. Poor Time Management</strong></p> <p>Students often procrastinate, leaving assignments until the last minute. This leads to stress, poor results, and an even greater dislike for studying.</p> <p><strong>4. Overdependence on Shortcuts</strong></p> <p>With Google and AI tools, many students expect instant answers. This reduces their willingness to engage in deep reading or critical thinking.</p> <p><strong>5. Peer Influence</strong></p> <p>When friends do not value education, students may follow the same pattern, thinking studying is uncool or unnecessary.</p> <p><strong>6. Lack of Encouragement at Home</strong></p> <p>In many families, parents are too busy or uninvolved to supervise homework or encourage good study habits.</p> <p><strong>7. Weak Study Environment</strong></p> <p>Noise, lack of access to libraries, and absence of quiet places make concentration difficult for many learners.</p> <p><strong>8. Poor Teaching Methods</strong></p> <p>Some students lose interest because teaching styles are boring, outdated, or not interactive enough to keep them engaged.</p> <p><strong>9. Mental Health Challenges</strong></p> <p>Anxiety, stress, and depression are on the rise among young people, making studying seem like an extra burden rather than an opportunity.</p> <p><strong>10. Overloaded Curriculum</strong></p> <p>In some schools, the curriculum is too heavy, leaving students drained and uninterested in studying further outside the classroom.</p> <p><strong>How to Reverse This Trend</strong></p> <p>While the problem of student laziness is complex, it is not impossible to solve. It requires a joint effort from governments, parents, and educators to restore the culture of discipline and passion for learning.</p> <p><strong>Role of Government:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Provide modern learning infrastructure such as digital libraries, labs, and interactive classrooms.</li> <li>Review and update the curriculum to make it more practical and skill-oriented rather than purely theoretical.</li> <li>Support campaigns that highlight the importance of education and reduce societal distractions that undermine learning.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Role of Parents:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Monitor children’s screen time and encourage a balance between entertainment and academics.</li> <li>Create a study-friendly environment at home with less noise and more encouragement.</li> <li>Lead by example by showing a positive attitude toward lifelong learning.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Role of Educators:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Adopt modern teaching methods that are interactive, technology-driven, and student-centered.</li> <li>Encourage project-based learning and teamwork to make studying more practical and enjoyable.</li> <li>Mentor students not only academically but also morally, motivating them to see the value of education in real life.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Students today face more distractions and challenges than ever before, but laziness to study should not define their future. With combined support from governments, parents, and educators, it is possible to bring back the era when learning was a priority and a source of pride. The responsibility lies with all of us to make studying meaningful again and to ensure that the next generation is well-prepared for the future.</p>"

  "title": "Best Methods to Read and Assimilate",
  "date": "2025-08-31",

  "excerpt": "Discover practical study techniques tailored for primary, secondary, and higher education students. From active recall to spaced repetition, this article draws on proven strategies and educational philosophies to help learners retain knowledge and excel academically.",
  "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slide-t/achsosa-93alumni/main/images/reading2.jpg",
  "content": "<p>Reading and assimilation are not just academic skills; they are life-long habits that determine how effectively a student learns, remembers, and applies knowledge. In today’s fast-paced world where distractions are everywhere, the ability to read deeply and assimilate effectively has become more important than ever. Whether a child is in primary school, a teenager in secondary school, or a young adult in higher education, good reading and learning strategies are critical.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Primary School Level</strong><br>At the primary level, children are just developing foundational skills. Their ability to focus is short, so methods must be engaging and playful. Teachers and parents should introduce <em>phonics, storytelling, and reading aloud</em>. These methods not only build word recognition but also improve comprehension. Picture books with bold illustrations stimulate the imagination and improve memory. A key strategy here is <em>guided repetition</em>. Children learn faster when stories are repeated in creative ways, such as role-playing. As the educational philosopher Maria Montessori once said: <q>The goal of early childhood education should be to activate the child’s own natural desire to learn.</q></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Secondary School Level</strong><br>At this stage, students are exposed to more complex texts and are expected to study independently. Unfortunately, distractions from social media and peer pressure often make this difficult. To improve assimilation, students should adopt the <em>Pomodoro technique</em>—25 minutes of focused study followed by a 5-minute break. Note-taking strategies like <em>Cornell notes</em> and <em>mind mapping</em> help in organizing thoughts. Group study sessions can be beneficial, but they must be structured to prevent idle talk. Encouraging self-discipline is essential, echoing John Dewey’s philosophy that: <q>Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.</q></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Higher Institution of Learning</strong><br>In universities and colleges, reading goes beyond understanding—it requires critical analysis and application. Students must learn to filter through large amounts of information, highlight key points, and relate theories to practical examples. Advanced strategies such as <em>SQ3R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)</em> help in breaking down textbooks into manageable parts. Assimilation improves when students engage in discussions, debates, and presentations. Effective time management and creating a distraction-free environment are also vital. As Paulo Freire wrote in <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>: <q>Education either functions as an instrument to facilitate integration of the younger generation into the logic of the present system or becomes the practice of freedom.</q></p>\n\n<p><strong>General Assimilation Techniques</strong><br>Across all levels, there are universal strategies that improve reading and assimilation: <ul><li>Reading in a quiet, well-lit environment</li><li>Writing summaries in your own words</li><li>Using flashcards for key concepts</li><li>Teaching what you’ve learned to others</li><li>Sleeping well after studying to reinforce memory</li></ul></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Parents, Teachers, and Institutions</strong><br>Parents should encourage daily reading culture at home, limit screen time, and create routines. Teachers must make learning interactive and engaging, ensuring students remain active participants. Schools and governments can provide libraries, digital resources, and training on study skills. Together, they can revive a culture of reading where learning is prioritized above distractions.</p>\n\n<p><em>In conclusion</em>, reading and assimilation are not talents reserved for a few—they are skills that can be developed with the right approach. By combining discipline, creativity, and effective strategies, students at all levels can master the art of learning and secure their path to excellence. As Aristotle famously said: <q>The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.</q></p>"
